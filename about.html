        <h3>Brief Intro</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Adam and I am father of three kids. I'm also in a serious relationship with my future wife Trisha. <br>
            We have a Siberian Husky by the name of Sadie. I was in U.S. Navy for about 10 years Active Duty and 2 years <br>
            in the CA Army National Guard.</p>

                <p>This is Trisha and I. We have been in relationship for many years and <br>
                   we are looking to start our lives together in hopes to purchasing a home <br>
                   this year and planning to get married shortly! </p>

                <p>This is our Siberian Husky. Her name is Sadie. <br> 
                   came up with her name when I was thinking of the <br>
                   city in AZ by the name of Sedona. I've always like <br>
                   the sound of it and so therefore, I shortened her name!</p
